    Andrew is fascinated by bird migration and uses rapidly expanding technologies for studying bird
    movements, including weather surveillance radar, acoustic monitoring, video monitoring and
    citizen science. He is a Research Associate in the Information Science Program at the 
    [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/). Within GloBAM, Andrew is leading efforts to
    quantify and characterize the biomass flows of aerial migrants.

- name: Cecilia Nilsson
  role: Associated researcher
  image: assets/img/nilsson_photo.jpg
  description: >
    Cecilia is a behavioral ecologist, interested in flight behavior, bird migration and radar ornithology.
    She currently works at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/), where she
    studies large scale patterns of flight behavior using data from networks of weather radars. Within
    GloBAM she is working on questions relating to large scale differences between migration systems
    and combining European and US weather radar data.

- name: Baptiste Schmid
  role: Associated researcher
  image: assets/img/schmid_photo.jpg
  description: >
    Baptiste is fascinated by observing animal movements and works with radar systems to investigate
    the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass migratory movements. He feels very fortunate to conduct
    research on avian migration at the
    [Swiss Ornithological Institute](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/home/). Within GloBAM, Baptiste is
    working to improve our ability to distinguish bats and insects from birds in radar signals.

- name: Nadja Weisshaupt
  role: Post-doctoral researcher
  image: assets/img/weisshaupt_photo.JPG
  description: >
    Born a birdwatcher, Nadjaâ€™s main research interests are bird migration and conservation. In recent 
    years she has focused particualrly on radar ornithology. She works as a post-doctoral ornithologist 
    at the [Finnish Meteorological Institute](https://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/). In GloBAM, her primary 
    focus is the development of a bird migration model for the Finnish airspace.
