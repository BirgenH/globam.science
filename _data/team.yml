  description: >
    Jason is a movement ecologist interested in the evolution of animal migration strategies, and the 
    population and community-level effects of these long-range movements. He uses novel 
    technologies including biological radars to characterize the migration ecology of insects and 
    birds. Jason is an associate professor at the [University of Exeter](http://www.exeter.ac.uk). Within 
    GloBAM, he will play a leading role in understanding insect migrations using radar data.

    Adriaan is an ecologist with a background in physics, with a keen interest in animal migration and 
    foraging ecology. He is a Research Associate in the Information Science Program at the [Cornell 
    Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/), where his research bridges the disciplines of 
    ornithology, ecology, physics and computer science. Adriaan’s recent work focuses on quantifying 
    the biomass flows of birds across large continental areas; he will continue this focus during 
    GloBAM.

  description: >
    Andrew is fascinated by bird migration and uses rapidly expanding technologies for studying bird
    movements, including weather surveillance radar, acoustic monitoring, video monitoring and
    citizen science. He is a Research Associate in the Information Science Program at the 
    [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/). Within GloBAM, Andrew is leading efforts to
    quantify and characterize the biomass flows of aerial migrants.

- name: Birgen Haest
  role: Post-doctoral researcher
  image: assets/img/haest_photo.jpg
  description: >
    Birgen is a computational ecologist interested in solving complex ecological issues by using novel 
    data analysis techniques and acquisition technologies. He has expertise in bird migration, climate 
    change, phenology, remote sensing and statistical inference. Birgen will shortly be starting a post-
    doctoral position within the Bird Migration Department of the 
    [Swiss Ornithological Institute](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/home/), where he will focus on
    quantifying and understanding insect migration using radar data.

- name: Tom Mason
  role: Post-doctoral researcher
  image: assets/img/mason_image.jpg
  description: >
    Tom is a conservation ecologist interested in how wild animal populations respond to changes in
    their environment. He works as a post-doctoral researcher within the Bird Migration Department
    of the [Swiss Ornithological Institute](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/home/). Tom’s primary research
    focus within GloBAM is to develop spatial models of bird migration exploring how migratory journeys
    will be affected by global environmental change.

  description: >
    Cecilia is a behavioral ecologist, interested in flight behavior, bird migration and radar ornithology.
    She currently works at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/), where she
    studies large scale patterns of flight behavior using data from networks of weather radars. Within
    GloBAM she is working on questions relating to large scale differences between migration systems
    and combining European and US weather radar data.

  description: >
    Raphaël is fascinated by the ability of birds to navigate and time their migratory journeys. He uses 
    geostatistical methods to study spatio-temporal patterns of bird migration. He is a post-doctoral 
    researcher at the [Swiss Ornithological Institute](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/home/). As part 
    of GloBAM, Raphaël is focusing on modelling and quantifying nocturnal bird migration using 
    weather radar data.
