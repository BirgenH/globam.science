Part of the international aeroecological community, including many GloBAM partners, has been in Zhengzhou, China for the [2nd International Radar Aeroecology Conference](https://hysite.txlcinfo.com/Portal/Index). It was a great meeting – not only because we saw again many old friends and colleagues, but we also made many new ones. Our Chinese hosts have been extremely attentive and treated us to yummy Chinese food!

There were 33 presentation and pdf-copies of all of them can be found at the [conference website](https://hysite.txlcinfo.com/Portal/PPTdownloadIndex). Since my presentation was the last one of the conference, I tried to assign all contributions to the [grand challenges in migration ecology that we identified earlier]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.04083) and also drew a few personal conclusions that I repeat here: Interestingly, there were contributions for all migration-ecology challenges that we identified! Perhaps this is not so surprising after all – as several of us identified the challenges (and the international network helped scoring them), it’s perhaps a logical consequence that we also work on them. But still, the diversity of topics was high - from identification of migration routes, important sites, and continental flyways to quantifications of migrant numbers and biomasses; from environmental influences to the effects of migrants on communities and ecosystems; from climate change effects to impact of human-made structures. Finally, many contributions also dealt with methodological and technical challenges that come with the installation of new radar technology. Especially, new methods of identifying shape, size or other characteristics of insects or birds. And, of course, many talks addressed more than one challenge.

Summarizing across talks, I found the continental differences in research focus and primary taxa studied quite fascinating. For instance, research is clearly bird-biased in the US and Europe while insects are the main focus in Chinese aeroecology, and hardly anything has been done with the respectively other taxon. Naturally, these differences result from varying research histories, varying incentives from the public, or from economy or agriculture (pest insects have long been an issue in Chinese agriculture) and varying data accessibility. This raises interesting questions about how similar or different bird/insect migration is in China, the US and Europe – in terms of patterns, numbers, etc. – which, I’m sure, we could tackle within the next years.

Apart from these differences, there were also interesting several similarities in research questions that seem to be shared globally, e.g. on the response of birds and insects to wind, and the impact of human structures such as wind turbines on bird movements.

After all the science, I joined the after-conference excursion to the Shaolin temple in the song mountains, which was astonishing, amazing and fun! (It’s a no-brainer that at any aeroecology conference/meeting/workshop, there will be some bird-watching opportunity, and following this tradition, all die-hard birders and twitchers could go on a bird-watching excursion to the Yellow river wetlands.)

_Everyone who watched Kung Fu Panda 1-3 in preparation for the visit to China as I did will remember Master Oogway and be extremely delighted to learn that “oogway” is the Chinese word for guess what? … Exactly! I knew Kung Fu Panda was going to be extremely helpful!_
