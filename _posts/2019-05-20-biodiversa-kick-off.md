Peter, Nadja and Silke attended the kick-off meeting organised for all projects funded within this BioDivERsa-call. This was actually a 3-in-1 meeting as there was a data management workshop, the actual kick-off meeting, and a research and innovation workshop with stakeholder.

The aim of the data management workshop was to exchange best practises related to data management and included lectures on open data principles and concepts, data management plans and how to manage and publish biodiversity data. Thanks to Peter and our earlier work, GloBAM’s data management plan is quite clear, advanced and doesn’t need much more work!

At the kick-off meeting, all funded projects were briefly introduced, grouped into thematic sessions. This project-introductions remained quite vague, which might be expected at this stage - all projects had only just started, naturally everyone has great plans and expectedly, there were no results yet to present and thus, also only limited discussions on the science within the projects. Most projects are thematically quite different from ours, perhaps with the exception of “Future BirdScenarios” - but have a look yourself in the brochure http://www.biodiversa.org/1571 that briefly introduces all funded projects. Thus, although encouraged from the BioDivERsA office and the Belmont forum, I’m afraid I don’t see too much potential for collaborations with other projects.

Finally, another important aspect of BioDivERsA projects is engaging stakeholders. In the last workshop, stakeholders from two sectors – tourism and forestry and agriculture – were present and could express their interest for outcomes of projects or specific aspects of them. For GloBAM, these might not be the most important stakeholders – at least, at this early stage – but stakeholders from agriculture would certainly be interested in learning more about, e.g. the movements of agricultural pests.
