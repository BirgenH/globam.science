A month after the World Economic Forum, the little town of Davos in the Eastern Swiss Alps hosted the World Biodiversity Forum 
<https://www.worldbiodiversityforum.org/index.html>.

It was organized primarily by Uni Zürich and particularly by its university research program “Global change and biodiversity” 
<https://www.gcb.uzh.ch/en.html>. The conference program clearly reflected the research focus of its organisers: 
current state of remote sensing and its future developments. 

Surprisingly few, i.e. almost none, contributions had anything to do with animal movements and how that might shape biodiversity or 
be an integral part of biodiversity.

Only a side-note - Davos is situated almost 1600 m a.s.l., a traditional famous ski resort and home to Hockey Club Davos, 
its premier league ice hockey team. Despite the altitude and time of the year, there was surprisingly little snow and actually the 
first for me in this winter season!
